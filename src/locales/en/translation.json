      "ucmas-title": "About UCMAS",
      "ucmas-description": "Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System (UCMAS) is a globally recognized, scientifically-proven child development program designed for children aged 4 to 13 years, when brain development is at its peak. Since 1993, UCMAS has transformed the lives of over 3 million children across more than 80 countries worldwide through 5,000+ centers. At Harvest International School, we proudly offer UCMAS as an enrichment program to develop our students' cognitive abilities far beyond traditional mathematics education. The program uses the abacus, an ancient Chinese calculating tool, to develop extraordinary mental arithmetic capabilities. Children begin by learning to manipulate the abacus beads with both hands, which activates both hemispheres of the brain simultaneously—the left logical hemisphere for mathematical formulas and sequencing, and the right creative hemisphere for visualization and spatial memory. Through systematic training, students progress from physical abacus use to visualizing a mental abacus, storing over 450,000 abacus images in their minds by program completion. This visualization technique enables students to perform complex calculations—including multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—faster than calculators, often solving 10-digit arithmetic problems in seconds. The benefits of UCMAS extend far beyond mathematical ability. The program significantly enhances Concentration, as children learn to focus on multiple simultaneous processes while filtering out distractions. Observation skills are sharpened through rapid flashcard training, teaching students to capture information at a glance. Listening abilities improve through high-speed oral arithmetic exercises. Visualization and Imagination are developed as students create and manipulate mental images of the abacus. Memory, particularly photographic memory, is strengthened as children memorize bead patterns and momentarily retain each calculation image before producing answers. Speed and Accuracy improve as students are progressively challenged to deliver precise results in decreasing time intervals. Creativity flourishes as right-brain activation facilitates innovative thinking and problem-solving. Self-Confidence grows through continuous positive feedback from parents, teachers, and peers, as well as through participation in competitions and public demonstrations of their abilities. The program's impact is supported by research from Harvard University and has received ISO 9001:2008 certification, making UCMAS the first organization in the mental arithmetic industry to achieve this distinction. Students receive systematic training through professionally curated courses with daily 15-20 minute practice assignments that develop strong work habits and discipline. At Harvest International School, UCMAS students consistently demonstrate superior academic performance, enhanced learning abilities across all subjects, and increased confidence in tackling challenging problems—skills that prepare them for success not just in mathematics, but in all areas of life and future careers."
